# AllTheMods9 Community Expert Edition
ATM9 Community Expert Edition - An Expert style modpack based on ATM9 with a focus on completing more challenging goals and tasks on your way to the Star.

**Disclaimer**: For now, this pack is in no way associated with the official ATM9 Pack or ATM Team. This is an undertaking completely by myself because I love their work but wanted it to be more challenging.

### How does it work?
This pack is based on all the work on the Official ATM9 pack. So all the mods and original configs and such will be 
found there. This repository, will contain various patches that will be injected into an existing installation.
This may include things such as config overwrites, mods added, mods removed, etc. The work on this pack will be meant to 
be played with specific versions of ATM9. The code here is written in NodeJS, and as part of the build and release 
process, will generate a binary that you can download. This binary will allow you to run it on your PC to "upgrade" an existing
ATM9 install to the Community Expert Edition.

### Read This First!
- You should only do this on new and fresh installations of ATM9. If you have an existing world and use a mod that we remove or tinker, it may break things. You have been warned!
- If you have a regular ATM9 World that you want to keep, you should create a new profile specifically for this pack. You can easily do this in CurseForge.
- This pack was not meant to be rolled back. So again, please use this on a fresh install for a new world. Once you upgrade, you cannot undo it without deleting everything!
